## Repo layout

- Cargo workspace at repo root (`Cargo.toml`, `members = ["crates/engine"]`).
- `crates/engine` — the core engine lib crate (`stackfish-engine`).
- `crates/engine/src/types/` — strictly data types, no behavior: `ids`, `mana`, `card`, `zone`,
  `counter`, `object`, `cost`, `stack`, `effect`, `event`, `turn`, `command`, `player`, `game`.
  `types/mod.rs` declares all of them and flat-re-exports everything (`pub use card::*` etc).
  `lib.rs` just does `pub mod types; pub use types::*;`. Logic (the step-able rules processor,
  script bridge, etc., once those get built in later phases) goes in sibling top-level modules
  under `crates/engine/src/`, *not* into `types/` — kept the data/behavior split visible at the
  folder level from the start, per the human's request, rather than letting it implicitly
  fall out of one flat module list.
- Internal imports inside `types/` use full `crate::types::modname::Item` paths (not relative
  `super::`) — explicit about where things live now that there's a nesting level. Files outside
  `types/` can still use the flat `crate::TypeName` form via the root re-export.
- `bitflags` is the one external dependency so far (used for `CardTypeSet`, `SupertypeSet`,
  `ColorSet`).

## Phase 1 status

Structs only, no function bodies, per `docs/workflow.md` Phase 1 rules. Builds clean
(`cargo build`, zero warnings) as of this writing. Went through two review rounds with the
human; first round caught real modeling gaps (see below), second round caught a wrong technical
claim I made (see "Mistakes caught" at the bottom — don't repeat it).

## Decisions and rationale, by area

### Bitmasks vs bool-structs

`CardTypeSet`, `SupertypeSet`, `ColorSet` are `bitflags`-backed bitmasks (`u16`/`u8`/`u8`), each
paired with a plain enum (`CardType`, `Supertype`, `Color`) for matching/comparison. First draft
had these as structs of `bool` fields mislabeled "bitflags" — not an actual bitmask, just looked
like one. Caught by the human across two separate instances (`CardTypeSet`/`Supertype` first,
then `ColorSet` for the same reason) — if a new flag-set type gets added later, default to the
bitmask + enum pair from the start, not bools.

### Mana symbols (`mana.rs`)

`AtomicManaSymbol` (the indivisible unit: `Colored`, `Generic`, `Colorless`, `Snow`,
`Phyrexian(Color)`) is separate from `ManaSymbol` (`Atom`, `Hybrid(Atomic, Atomic)`, `X`).

`Hybrid` is a fixed 2-tuple, not a `Vec`. Real-world shapes it needs to cover: color/color
(`{W/U}`), generic/color (`{2/W}`), and hybrid Phyrexian (`{W/U/P}`-style symbols, CR 107.4f).
The hybrid Phyrexian case does **not** need a third slot: `Phyrexian(Color)` already bundles two
payment options (that color, or 2 life) into a single atom, so pairing it with a second atom in
a 2-slot `Hybrid` — e.g. `Hybrid(Phyrexian(Blue), Colored(Green))` — yields three total ways to
pay using only two slots. I initially got this wrong (see "Mistakes caught" below); the fix was
realizing the atom itself can be inherently multi-way, not the container.

Plain Phyrexian (`{W/P}` on its own, no second color) is `Atom(Phyrexian(_))`, not a hybrid at
all — hybrid implies two *symbols* in the printed glyph, not two *payment options*.

### Power/toughness/loyalty/defense (`card.rs`)

`PTValue { Fixed(i32), CharacteristicDefining(String) }` replaces plain `Option<i32>` on
`CardDefinition`. Reason: some cards have non-fixed base P/T (`*`, `*+1`, etc. — characteristic-
defining abilities, CR 208). The numeric resolution doesn't need separate representation: the CDA
script callback returns the final resolved number regardless of how the oracle text phrases it.
The `String` (added by the human, not in my first draft) keeps the literal text (`"*"`, `"*+1"`)
for display/debugging — `oracle_text` on `CardDefinition` has the full rules text but not the
isolated P/T expression on its own.

Live in-game values are a different concern entirely — `EffectiveCharacteristics` (`effect.rs`)
holds plain resolved `i32`s, because by the time anything queries live characteristics, the
layer engine has already run any CDA and arrived at a concrete number. `CardDefinition` holds
the base/printed value (possibly dynamic); `EffectiveCharacteristics` holds the live value
(always concrete). Two different structs on purpose — collapsing them would mean storing a
"current value" as a mutable field somewhere, which breaks the layer engine's timestamp/
dependency reordering when multiple effects stack (CR 613).

### Zones (`zone.rs`, `object.rs`, `game.rs`)

Two-tier split: `ZoneKind` (enum: `Library`, `Hand`, `Battlefield`, `Graveyard`, `Stack`,
`Exile`, `Command`) vs `Zone` (struct: `kind: ZoneKind`, `owner: Option<PlayerId>` — `None` for
shared zones, `contents: VecDeque<ObjectId>`).

`GameObject.zone` is `ZoneKind` only, never a full `Zone`. Storing a whole `Zone` on every object
in it would embed that zone's entire sibling-id list onto each object — the exact "two places
that can drift out of sync" problem the human flagged for `zone_position` (see next item),
just bigger. The actual `Zone` instances (with `contents`) live solely in `GameState.zones:
Vec<Zone>` — one flat list, not a per-player struct, because each `Zone`'s own `owner` field
already disambiguates whose zone it is.

`GameObject` originally also had a `zone_position: u32` field for in-zone ordering. Removed:
ordering must live in exactly one place (the zone's `contents` order), not duplicated as a
second number on the object that has to be kept in sync by hand. `contents` is a `VecDeque`
specifically so the future zone-manipulation code (insert at top/bottom of library, etc.) has
that finer control without it needing to be a plain `Vec` shuffled by index.

The Stack is the deliberate exception: it's not one of the `Zone`s in `GameState.zones`. Stack
entries need `StackObject`'s metadata (chosen modes/targets/X/costs paid), not just an ordered
id list, so stack ordering lives in `GameState.stack: Vec<StackObject>` instead. Confirmed
explicitly with the human — don't try to fold the stack into the generic `Zone` model.

Caught (while doing the `types/` folder move, unrelated to the move itself) that
`GameEventKind::ZoneChange` in `event.rs` had `from`/`to` typed as the full `Zone` struct, not
`ZoneKind` — the same "don't embed the whole zone's contents into something smaller" mistake as
the `GameObject.zone` field had, just not caught the first time around since `event.rs` wasn't
under review then. Fixed to `ZoneKind`. Worth deliberately re-scanning for this same pattern if
any other field in the codebase still names a bare `Zone` where only the kind is meant.

`GameState.objects` is a `HashMap<ObjectId, GameObject>` (lookup-by-id store), not a flat `Vec`.
Needed `ObjectId` to derive `Hash`/`Eq` for this — added those derives (plus `Clone`/`Copy`) to
all the id newtypes in `ids.rs` for consistency, even though not all of them need it yet.

### Visibility (`object.rs`)

Kept `VisibilityPolicy` on `GameObject` despite the zone already implying a default visibility
(hidden zones vs. public zones). Zone is the right *default*, but there are real per-object
exceptions a zone-only model can't express: a face-down permanent on the (public) battlefield
whose owner secretly knows its identity, or a card revealed to one player by a scry/surveil-
style effect while still sitting in a (hidden) library. `VisibilityPolicy` is an override layer
on top of the zone default, not the primary mechanism — confirmed with the human, this isn't
duplicate state in the same way `zone_position` was, because it's expressing genuinely different
information (exceptions), not redundantly restating the zone's default.

### Counters (`counter.rs`, `object.rs`, `player.rs`)

Counters were originally `Vec<(String, i32)>` on `GameObject` — no type safety, and CR 122.3
lists 100+ named counter kinds (mostly flavor, no rules significance). Added a shared
`CounterKind` enum with variants for the ones that actually matter to rules logic
(`PlusOnePlusOne`, `MinusOneMinusOne`, `Loyalty`, `Poison`, `Energy`, `Experience`, `Charge`) plus
`Custom(String)` for everything else. Shared between `GameObject.counters` (object-level, e.g.
+1/+1 counters) and the new `PlayerState.counters` (player-level, e.g. poison/energy/experience —
these were missing entirely from the first draft of `PlayerState`). `GameEventKind::CounterAdded`
updated to use `CounterKind` too, for the same reason.

### Emblems (`player.rs`)

Modeled as a standalone `Emblem { emblem_id, source, ability_text }` struct directly on
`PlayerState.emblems`, not as a `GameObject`. Reason: emblems live in the command zone per CR
114.1, but they have no `CardDefinition` — no mana cost, no type line, no database entry — so
forcing them through the `GameObject` model (which is built around having a `CardDefinition`)
would mean a fake/empty definition just to satisfy the type. Simpler to keep them as their own
small type. Revisit if the zone model ever needs to enumerate "everything in the command zone"
uniformly (would currently miss emblems).

### Cost/payment (`cost.rs`)

`AdditionalCost` filter fields (`Sacrifice`, `Discard`, `TapPermanents`) were raw `String`
descriptions. Replaced with a structured `FilterSpec { card_types: Option<CardTypeSet>,
controller: Option<FilterController>, random: bool, extra: Option<String> }` — covers the common
shapes (type + controller + count + random-selection) structurally, with `extra` as a script-
bind-time-refined catch-all for filters that don't reduce to that (power/toughness thresholds,
named-card restrictions, etc).

`PaymentPlan` flow (the human asked for this to be explained, documented in `cost.rs` directly):
a `CostSpec` describes what's owed but not how it'll be paid. The host collects the player's
choices (which lands to tap, which creature to sacrifice, whether to take an alternative cost)
via `PlayerActionKind::SubmitPayment` and assembles a `PaymentPlan`. The engine validates the
whole plan atomically against the `CostSpec` and only commits it (taps lands, sacrifices,
deducts mana) if everything checks out — no partial payment ever lands in game state.

### Commands vs. actions (`command.rs`)

`EngineCommand` mirrors `PlayerActionKind` 1:1 — there's no lower command tier ("pay cost", "push
onto stack", etc.) underneath it. The human asked for this to be explained explicitly since it
wasn't obvious; reasoning, documented in the file:

A `Command` represents one validated *player decision*. The internal sub-steps of carrying it
out (move card to stack zone, deduct mana, create the `StackObject`) aren't further decisions —
they're `GameEvent` facts the engine produces while executing the one decision it was given. When
casting genuinely needs *another* decision mid-flight (e.g. "sacrifice a creature" as an
additional cost — which one?), that's not a lower-level command either: it's the next
`PlayerAction` in the stream, at the same tier as `CastSpell`, with the engine just pausing
between `step()` calls expecting `SubmitPayment` next. This is also why `SubmitPayment` is its
own `PlayerActionKind` variant rather than folded into `CastSpell`.

### Effect naming and durations (`effect.rs`)

Renamed `ContinuousEffectInstance` -> `ContinuousEffect` and `ReplacementEffectInstance` ->
`ReplacementEffect` per the human's preference — avoid `*Instance` suffixes in type names
generally going forward.

`EffectDuration` was missing real cases: added `UntilYourNextTurn`, `UntilEndOfCombat`, and
`WhileConditionHolds` (for "as long as you control a Forest"-style durations that are
re-evaluated continuously rather than ending at a fixed point), plus a `Custom(String)`
catch-all for unusual oracle wording.

### Pre-game (`turn.rs`)

Added `Phase::PreGame` — not a CR-defined phase, but the engine needs somewhere to sit during
setup (shuffling, mulligans, commander/partner reveal, opening hand) before the turn loop's
first `Beginning` phase. The host steps the engine out of it explicitly once setup resolves.

### Life vs. damage, and the `Target` gap (`ids.rs`, `command.rs`, `stack.rs`, `event.rs`)

CR 119 (life) and CR 120 (damage) are related but distinct: damage prevention
shields stop damage, not generic life loss; "whenever you lose life" and
"whenever a source deals damage to you" are separate trigger conditions that
can both fire off one damage event; damage to a permanent marks damage
(`GameObject.damage_marked`), while damage to a player converts straight to
life loss with no marked-damage state of its own. `PlayerState::lose_life`/
`gain_life` are the literal CR 119 primitives — used directly for life-loss/
gain effects, and also as the downstream effect when a (not-yet-written)
damage-resolution step in the engine loop decides a player takes a hit.
Damage itself stays `GameEventKind::DamageDealt`, not something `PlayerState`
knows about.

That question surfaced a real gap while checking it: `DamageDealt`'s
`target` field was typed `ObjectId`, which can't represent damage *to a
player* — players aren't `GameObject`s in this model. The same gap existed
in `command.rs`'s `targets: Vec<ObjectId>` (`CastSpell`/`ActivateAbility`)
and in `StackObject.targets` — none of them could target a player, despite
plenty of real cards targeting "any target" (player, creature, planeswalker,
battle). Fixed with a shared `Target { Object(ObjectId), Player(PlayerId) }`
in `ids.rs`, swapped in everywhere a target slot existed. Also caught the
same shape of bug in `DeclareAttackers`: it had `attackers: Vec<ObjectId>`
and a separate `defending_players: Vec<PlayerId>`, which (a) couldn't
represent attacking a planeswalker/battle (CR 506.4) and (b) didn't even
pair each attacker with *which* defender it was attacking — two parallel
lists don't encode that pairing. Changed to
`attackers: Vec<(ObjectId, Target)>`. `MakeChoice.selection` got the same
treatment (`Vec<Target>`) since "choose a player" is a real choice shape.

`Target` does *not* cover battles/planeswalkers as a separate case — those
are still `Object(ObjectId)` since they're `GameObject`s like any other
permanent. `Player` only exists because a player is the one targetable/
damageable thing in the game that isn't a `GameObject` at all.

## Phase 2, part 2: core engine loop signatures

New top-level modules (logic, sibling to `types/`, per the data/behavior split from the folder
restructure): `engine.rs`, `commands.rs`, `layers.rs`, `replacement.rs`, `sba.rs`, `triggers.rs`.

- `engine::Engine` wraps `GameState` with `submit_action`/`step`. `StepResult.events_added` is a
  `Range<usize>` into `Engine::state().ledger` rather than cloned-out events — the ledger already
  has them, this just tells the caller which slice is new.
- `commands::execute_command` carries out one already-accepted `EngineCommand`, mutating
  `GameState` and appending to its ledger — no return value beyond `Result<(), CommandError>`,
  since the ledger append *is* the observable result.
- `layers::effective_characteristics` is the CR 613 layer-engine query that
  `EffectiveCharacteristics` (in `effect.rs`) was waiting on since Phase 1. Will need a
  script-runtime handle threaded through eventually (to resolve `PTValue::CharacteristicDefining`
  via the card's script callback) — not added yet since the script bridge itself isn't designed.
- `replacement::apply_replacements` has a known open gap: CR 616.1 has the *affected player*
  choose ordering when multiple replacements could apply to the same event. A pure
  `&GameState -> GameEventKind` function can't resolve a player decision — this will likely need
  to return a choice request in the ambiguous case instead of always a resolved event. Signature
  is a first pass, documented as likely to change.
- `sba::check_state_based_actions` is one pass, not the CR 704.3 fixed-point loop — `engine.rs`'s
  loop is responsible for calling it repeatedly until it returns empty, not the function itself,
  so a replay viewer stepping one ledger entry at a time can observe each pass separately.
- `triggers::PendingTrigger` is deliberately not part of `GameState` — it's transient process
  state between "a trigger matched" and "it's been placed on the stack as a `StackObject`," not
  part of the authoritative game model. `collect_triggers` finds matches; `order_apnap` is a
  separate step since ordering is independent of matching.

## Phase 2, part 3: script bridge (mlua)

Added `mlua = { version = "0.9", features = ["lua54", "vendored"] }` to `crates/engine/Cargo.toml`
(vendored so it doesn't need a system Lua install). New files: `script.rs` (`ScriptRuntime`,
`ScriptContext`, `ScriptError`) and `script_api.rs` (the `Game.*` surface named in DESIGN.md —
`register_triggered_ability`, `add_continuous_effect`, `replace_event`, `cast_spell`, `pay_cost`,
`select_targets`). Both are logic, sibling to `types/`, same as `engine.rs`/`commands.rs`/etc.

Doing this surfaced a real Phase 1 gap: there was no struct for a card's *registered* ability
(the thing `Game.RegisterTriggeredAbility` actually creates — condition/cost/target/operation
script handles, per ygopro's effect lifecycle). `ContinuousEffect`/`ReplacementEffect` existed;
the more basic "ability" type didn't. Added `types/ability.rs`: `AbilityKind` (Triggered/
Activated/Static) + `RegisteredAbility`, stored flat on `GameState.abilities` (same pattern as
`continuous_effects`/`replacement_effects` — scan-friendly, not nested under `GameObject`).

Also added `ScriptHandle` (`types/ids.rs`) — an opaque newtype handle into a loaded Lua callback,
deliberately *not* an `mlua::Function` held directly, so data types (`ContinuousEffect`,
`ReplacementEffect`, `RegisteredAbility`) can say "which script" without themselves depending on
`mlua` or holding VM-tied state. Used it to finally give concrete types to two Phase 1 String
placeholders that were explicitly marked "decided in Phase 2": `ContinuousEffect.affected_predicate`
and `ReplacementEffect.event_pattern` are now `ScriptHandle`, not `String`.

Also restored `StackObject.operation: ScriptHandle` — the original adaptation doc's `StackObject`
spec named a "resolution callback reference" that got dropped in Phase 1 (nothing to type it as,
yet). Without it, nothing on the stack would know what to actually run when it resolves.

Removed a leftover duplicate: Phase 1's placeholder `StepResult` marker struct in `game.rs` (data
module) is gone now that the real one lives in `engine.rs` (logic module) with actual fields.

Two deliberately-unsolved design problems, surfaced rather than papered over with a wrong-shaped
signature:

- **Hidden information.** `ScriptContext.state` is the full `&GameState` for now — exactly the
  leak DESIGN.md's open question warns about (a script could read an opponent's hand off it).
  Kept full-state only to get the call shape down; needs a visibility-filtered view before this
  is real.
- **Player-input-mid-script.** `ScriptRuntime::invoke_target` and `script_api::select_targets`
  both need to ask the player and get an answer back, but a player's answer arrives as a
  `PlayerAction` on a *later* `Engine::step()` call — it can't come back synchronously from within
  one Rust function call the way these signatures currently claim (`-> Vec<Target>`). Real fix is
  almost certainly Lua coroutines (`Lua::create_thread`, yield from the Lua callback, resume once
  the engine has the player's answer) spanning multiple `step()` calls. Signatures are written
  synchronously anyway for this first pass — they're very likely to change shape once the
  coroutine plumbing is designed, flagged in both places rather than treated as settled.

## Phase 3: TODO annotation

Every `todo!()` body across `types/` and the logic modules got a specific `// TODO:` comment
above it describing what needs implementing, referencing the relevant struct/field/CR rule.
`todo!()` itself stays as the body so the crate still compiles and panics if a stub is ever hit.

Writing those TODOs surfaced several more real gaps (same pattern as Phase 1/2 — writing the next
layer of detail keeps finding holes in the layer below). Noting each since they'll block Phase 7:

- `CounterKind` has no `PartialEq` (or any derive) — `CounterSet::count`/`add` can't compare kinds
  without it. Trivial fix, just not done yet (Phase 3 is comments-only).
- `GameObject::new` doesn't distinguish "brand new object" from "successor of a zone change" —
  the latter needs a populated `ObjectLineage`, the former needs `None`. One constructor covers
  neither cleanly; likely needs two, or a `lineage` parameter.
- `commands::execute_command`'s `DeclareAttackers`/`DeclareBlockers` handling has nowhere to put
  combat state — `GameState` has no combat-state field at all yet.
- `ReplacementEffect` can match an event (`event_pattern`) but has no field for what it actually
  rewrites the event into — only the matcher is modeled, not the effect. `replace_event` (script
  API) also can't construct one anyway since it has no `ConsumptionPolicy` parameter.
- `register_triggered_ability`'s signature has no `AbilityKind` parameter despite needing one to
  construct a `RegisteredAbility` — can't tell triggered/activated/static apart from the call.
- `script_api::pay_cost` has no `CostSpec` parameter to validate the `PaymentPlan` against, despite
  `PaymentPlan::validate` requiring one.
- `ScriptRuntime::invoke_operation` takes `&mut ScriptContext`, but `ScriptContext.state` is `&
  GameState` (shared, not mutable) — an operation callback needs to call back into `Game.*`
  functions that take `&mut GameState`. The mutability story isn't sorted, not just the Lua call
  mechanics.
- `triggers::order_apnap` can order *between* controllers but not *within* one controller's own
  set of simultaneous triggers — CR 603.3b leaves that order up to the controller, a decision this
  pure function can't make alone. Same shape of problem as the replacement-effect-ordering gap and
  the player-input-mid-script gap already tracked — there's a recurring pattern of "a pure
  `&GameState -> X` function hits a point where it actually needs a player decision."

## Phase 4: Verification Setup

Three new workspace crates/dirs:

- `crates/scenario` (lib, `stackfish-scenario`) — loads a declarative TOML scenario (players, ad-
  hoc test cards, initial zone placement, an action sequence, assertions), builds a real
  `GameState`, drives it through `Engine`, reports what happened.
- `crates/cli` (bin, `stackfish-cli`) — `cargo run -p stackfish-cli -- scenario.toml`. File-driven
  only, no live REPL yet — covers both a human (edit the file, rerun) and an AI agent (run via
  shell, read stdout) without needing real interactivity. Revisit if live typed-command
  exploration turns out to be wanted on top of this.
- `crates/engine/tests/scenarios.rs` + `crates/engine/tests/scenarios/*.toml` — real `cargo test`
  integration tests, one test that runs every scenario file in the directory.

**Key design point**: the scenario crate does *not* call the engine's still-`todo!()`
constructors (`GameObject::new`, `PlayerState::new`, `Zone::new`, etc) to build initial state —
it builds `GameState`/`GameObject`/`PlayerState`/`Zone` via direct struct literals, since their
fields are `pub`. That decouples the verification tool from which inherent-method bodies are
implemented yet, and means setup-plus-assertions scenarios (no actions) already run for real
today with zero panics — a genuine, currently-green baseline exercising the Phase 1 data model,
not a placeholder.

Two structs blocked even struct-literal construction because they have a private field
(`CounterSet.counters`, `Engine.state`) — implemented those two constructors for real, ahead of
phase order, since nothing else could exist without them:

- `CounterSet::new()` (counter.rs)
- `Engine::new()` / `Engine::state()` (engine.rs)

Running *actions* through `Engine::submit_action`/`step()` still hits `todo!()` until Phase 5/7 —
expected, and handled deliberately: `stackfish_scenario::run_action` wraps each action call in
`std::panic::catch_unwind`, so one stubbed action reports `StepOutcome::NotImplemented` instead of
aborting the whole scenario run. A scenario's assertions still run afterward and are checked for
real; `ScenarioReport::has_hard_failures()` only counts assertions that actually ran and got the
wrong answer, not unimplemented actions — that's the distinction that lets `cargo test` stay green
today while still being a real, tightening-over-time check as Phase 5/7 fill bodies in.

**Verification method (per workflow.md Phase 4):**

- COMMAND: `cargo test --workspace` (automated; also `cargo run -p stackfish-cli -- <scenario.toml>`
  for one-off manual/AI-driven runs against a specific scenario).
- EXPECTED: `cargo test --workspace` passes (0 failed). Individual scenario actions may report
  "not yet implemented" — that's expected pre-Phase 7, not a failure.
- FAILURE: any assertion in any scenario file producing a wrong answer, or a compile error.
- Confirmed passing on current codebase (baseline) — see `tests/scenarios/basic_setup.toml`
  (setup+assertions only, exercises the data model, currently green) and
  `tests/scenarios/pass_priority.toml` (exercises the action path, demonstrates the
  not-implemented-is-not-a-failure reporting).

**Scenario TOML schema (v1, intentionally simplified):**

Cards specify `generic_cost: u32` + `colors: [String]` rather than a parsed `"{2}{R}"`-style cost
string — no mana-cost-string parser exists anywhere, this sidesteps needing one just for fixtures.
`SubmitPayment` actions aren't supported yet — `PaymentPlan`'s `CostPayment` shapes are more
involved and the cost system itself isn't implemented either. Both are easy to extend later.

## Open items carried into Phase 2

- `StepResult` (`game.rs`) is a placeholder marker type with no fields yet — its real shape (what
  a caller can observe/act on after one `step()` call) is Phase 2 work.
- Concrete representation of script-bound callbacks (condition/cost/target/operation, in the
  ygopro-core sense) isn't decided yet — `ContinuousEffect`/`ReplacementEffect`'s `String`
  description fields are placeholders for whatever that representation turns out to be.
- mlua <-> Rust hidden-information boundary still unresolved (also tracked in `DESIGN.md`).

## Mistakes caught (don't repeat)

- Claimed hybrid Phyrexian mana symbols (`{W/U/P}`) needed a 3-element container because they're
  "a true 3-alternative choice." Wrong framing — confused *payment options* with *symbol slots*.
  An atom can itself carry multiple payment options (`Phyrexian(Color)` = color or life), so a
  2-slot `Hybrid` of two atoms can yield more than 2 total ways to pay. Before declaring a data
  shape "can't represent X," check whether an existing variant already absorbs the complexity.
